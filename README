Current directory structure is as follows:

- DnlinkTX: Ziria files implementing all parts of LTE Downlink transmitter
  - DnlinkTx/tests: unit tests for DnlinkTX

- MAC: C files that wrap Ziria files to compile into a full eNodeB

- eNodeB: Top-level Ziria files implementing eNodeB and scripts to make it. 
          Run make here to start eNodeB

- MatlabTests: Various matlab tests that verify Ziria code
  - MatlabTests/DnlinkTx: Matlab tests for DnlinkTX
    - MatlabTests/DnlinkTx/tests: unit tests for DnlinkTX

- Perf: Collection of documented performance evaluation results



*** High-level limitations:

* Uplink:
  - Uplink packet size is currently limited to 8 RBs. 
  - The receiver decodes uplink packets in every sub-frame, 
    regardless of whether something can be send 
    (depending on whether DCI0 grant was sent)
  - DCI0 is sent in subframe 0 of each frame. 

* Dnlink:
  - Currently, Dnlink packets are only sent in subframe 4 of each frame 
    (hardcoded in mac_tx_callback() in mac_tx.c)
  - Since we don't have a real-time feedback, we sent RAR in every frame
    It is hardcoded in subframe RAR_SUBFRAME (==6)
