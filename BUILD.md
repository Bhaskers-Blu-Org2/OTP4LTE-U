# Build instructions

To build OTP4LTE-U, one first needs to install [Ziria](https://github.com/dimitriv/Ziria/blob/master/BUILD). Please make sure Ziria is installed and all unit tests pass before attempting to run OTP4LTE-U. 


To make sure OTP4LTE-U is correctly installed, please run the unit test by typing

`make test-LTE-all`

All unit tests should pass if the environment is correctly set up. 



For instructions on how to build and run LTE-U, please see [README](LTE-U/README.md)
